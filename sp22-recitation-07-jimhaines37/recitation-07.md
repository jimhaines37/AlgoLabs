# CMPS 2200 Recitation 7

In this recitation, we'll look at huffman coding.

**To make grading easier, please place all written solutions directly in `answers.md`, rather than scanning in handwritten work or editing this file.**

All coding portions should go in `main.py` as usual.

## Fixed-Length vs. Variable-Length Codes

In class we looked at the Huffman coding algorithm for data
compresssion. Let's implement the algorithm and look at its empirical
performance on a dataset of 5 text files, which are `alice29.txt`, `asyoulik.txt`, `f1.txt`, `fields.c`, and `grammar.lsp`.

**a)** We have implemented a means to compute character frequencies
  in a text file with the function `get_frequencies` in
  `main.py`. Compute cost for a fixed length encoding for each text
  file in function `fixed_length_cost(f)` by calling function `get_frequencies`.

**b)** Complete the implementation of Huffman coding in
  `make_huffman_tree`. Note that we manipulate binary trees in the
  priority queue using the object `TreeNode`. Moreover, once the tree
  is constructed, we must compute the actual encodings by traversing
  the Huffman tree that has been constructed. To do this, complete the
  implementation of `get_code`, which is a typical recursive binary
  tree traversal. That is, given a tree node, we recursively visit the
  left and right subtrees, appending a `0` or `1` to the encoding in
  each direction as appropriate. If we visit a leaf of the tree (which
  represents a character in the alphabet) we store the
  collected encoding for that character in `code`.

**c)** Now implement `huffman_cost` to compute the cost of a Huffman
  encoding for a character set with given frequencies.

**d)** Test your implementation of Huffman coding on the 5 given text
files, and fill out a table of the encoding cost of each file for
fixed-length and Huffman. Fill out a final column which gives the
ratio of Huffman coding cost to fixed-length coding cost. Do you see a
consistent trend? If so, what is it?

**e)** Suppose that we used Huffman coding on a document with alphabet $\Sigma$ in
  which every character had the same frequency. What is the expected
  cost of a Huffman encoding for the document? Is it consistent across
  documents?
